How the code works:

Download and read the dataset into data frame
Use Rbind to join train and test data. Make sure data has the same structure.
Take standard deviation and mean from the data and extract only these measurements
Generate the activity labels, and replace indices with names.
Join the labels and the dataset using cbind. Do this for both mean and std deviation and X.
Calculate the aggregate using mean for averaging over activity and subject and save the result.
